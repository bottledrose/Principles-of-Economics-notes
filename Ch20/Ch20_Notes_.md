# Ch20 Income Inequality and Poverty



## 20-1 The Measurement of Inequality (And Problems)

We begin our study of the distribution of income by addressing four questions of
measurement:

+ How much inequality is there in our society?
+ How many people live in poverty?
+  What problems arise in measuring the amount of inequality?
+  How often do people move between income classes?

**poverty rate**: the percentage of the population whose family income falls below an absolute level(poverty line)

**poverty line**: an absolute level of income set by the federal government for each family size below which a family is deemed to be in poverty. This line depends on family size and is adjusted every year to account for changes in the level of prices.

Poverty is an economic malady that affects all groups within the population, but it does not affect all groups with equal frequency.

1. Poverty is correlated with race. Blacks and Hispanics are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as whites.
2. Poverty is correlated with age. Children are more likely than average to be members of poor families, and the elderly are less likely than average to be poor.
3. Poverty is correlated with family composition. Families headed by a single mother are about five times as likely to live in poverty as families headed by a married couple.

### 20-1d Problems in Measuring Inequality

For at least three reasons, data on the income distribution and the poverty rate give an incomplete picture of inequality in living standards:

1. Standard measurements of the degree of inequality do not include these in-kind transfers.

+ **In-kind transfers**: transfers to the poor given in the form of goods and services rather than cash

2. Normal life cycle pattern causes inequality in the distribution of annual income, but it does not necessarily represent true inequality in living standards.

life cycle: the regular pattern of income variation over a person’s life

3. Temporary income / permanent income affects the measurement of inequality



### 20-1e Economic Mobility

Economic mobility, the movement of people between income classes, is significant in the U.S. economy. Movements up the income ladder can be due to good luck or hard work, and movements down the ladder can be due to bad luck or laziness. Some of this mobility reflects transitory variation in income, while some reflects more persistent changes in income.

Another way to gauge economic mobility is the persistence of economic success from generation to generation.

## 20-2 The Political Philosophy of Redistributing Income

1. **utilitarianism功利主义**: the political philosophy according to which the government should choose policies to maximize the total utility of everyone in society.

The starting point of utilitarianism is the notion of utility.

+ **utility**: a measure of happiness or satisfaction

2. **liberalism自由主义**: the political philosophy according to which the government should choose policies deemed just, as evaluated by an impartial observer behind a “veil of ignorance”

+ **maximin criterion**: the claim that the government should aim to maximize the well-being of the worst-off person in society

+ **social insurance**: government policy aimed at protecting people against the risk of adverse events.

3. **libertarianism**: the political philosophy according to which the government should punish crimes and enforce voluntary agreements but not redistribute income.

## 20-3 Policies to Reduce Poverty

1. Minimum-Wage Laws
2. Welfare: government programs that supplement the incomes of the needy.
3. Negative Income Tax
4. In-Kind Transfers(实物转移支付)
5. Antipoverty Programs and Work Incentives
