## SUMMARY
- Data on the distribution of income show a wide disparity in U.S. society. The richest fifth of families earns more than twelve times as much income as the poorest fifth.
- Because in-kind transfers, the economic life cycle, transitory income, and economic mobility are so important for understanding variation in income, it is difficult to gauge the degree of inequality in our society using data on the distribution of income in a single year. When these other factors are taken into account, they tend to suggest that economic well-being is more equally distributed than is annual income.
- Political philosophers differ in their views about the role of government in altering the distribution of income. Utilitarians (such as John Stuart Mill) would choose the distribution of income that maximizes the sum of utility of everyone in society. Liberals (such as John Rawls) would determine the distribution of income as if we were behind a "veil of ignorance" that prevented us from knowing our stations in life. Libertarians (such as Robert Nozick) would have the government enforce individual rights to ensure a fair process but then would not be concerned about inequality in the resulting distribution of income.
- Various policies aim to help the poor-minimum-wage laws, welfare, negative income taxes, and in-kind transfers. While these policies help alleviate poverty, they also have unintended side effects. Because financial assistance declines as income rises, the poor often face very high effective marginal tax rates, which discourage poor families from escaping poverty on their own.
## QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

1. Does the richest fifth of the U.S. population earn closer to three, six, or twelve times the income of the poorest fifth?

2. What has happened to the income share of the richest fifth of the U.S. population over the past 40 years?

3. What groups in the U.S. population are most likely to live in poverty?

4. When gauging the amount of inequality, why do transitory and life cycle variations in income cause difficulties?

5. How would a utilitarian, a liberal, and a libertarian each determine how much income inequality is permissible?

6. What are the pros and cons of in-kind (rather than cash) transfers to the poor?

7. Describe how antipoverty programs can discourage the poor from working. How might you reduce this disincentive? What are the disadvantages of your proposed policy?
## PROBLEMS AND APPLICATIONS

1. Table 2 shows that income inequality in the United States has increased since 1970. Some factors contributing to this increase were discussed in Chapter 19. What are they?

2. Table 3 shows that the percentage of children in families with income below the poverty line far exceeds the percentage of the elderly in such families. How might the allocation of government money across different social programs have contributed to this phenomenon?

3. This chapter discusses the importance of economic mobility.

a. What policies might the government pursue to increase economic mobility within a generation?

b. What policies might the government pursue to increase economic mobility across generations?

c. Do you think we should reduce spending on current welfare programs to increase spending on programs that enhance economic mobility? What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of doing so?

4. Consider two communities. In one community, ten families have incomes of $\$ 100,000$ each and ten families have incomes of $\$ 20,000$ each. In the other community, ten families have incomes of $\$ 200,000$ each and ten families have incomes of $\$ 22,000$ each.

a. In which community is the distribution of income more unequal? In which community is the problem of poverty likely to be worse?

b. Which distribution of income would Rawls prefer? Explain.

c. Which distribution of income do you prefer? Explain.

d. Why might someone have the opposite preference?

5. This chapter uses the analogy of a "leaky bucket" to explain one constraint on the redistribution of income.

a. What elements of the U.S. system for redistributing income create the leaks in the bucket? Be specific.

b. Do you think that Republicans or Democrats generally believe that the bucket used for redistributing income is leakier? How does that belief affect their views about the amount of income redistribution that the government should undertake?

6. Suppose there are two possible income distributions in a society of ten people. In the first distribution, nine people have incomes of $\$ 30,000$ and one person has an income of $\$ 10,000$. In the second distribution, all ten people have incomes of $\$ 25,000$.

a. If the society had the first income distribution, what would be the utilitarian argument for redistributing income?

b. Which income distribution would Rawls consider more equitable? Explain.

c. Which income distribution would Nozick consider more equitable? Explain.

7. The poverty rate would be substantially lower if the market value of in-kind transfers were added to family income. The largest in-kind transfer is Medicaid, the government health program for the poor. Let's say the program costs $\$ 10,000$ per recipient family.

a. If the government gave each recipient family a $\$ 10,000$ check instead of enrolling them in the Medicaid program, do you think that most of these families would spend that money to purchase health insurance? Why? (Recall that the poverty level for a family of four is about $\$ 23,000$.)

b. How does your answer to part (a) affect your view about whether we should determine the poverty rate by valuing in-kind transfers at the price the government pays for them? Explain. c. How does your answer to part (a) affect your view about whether we should provide assistance to the poor in the form of cash transfers or in-kind transfers? Explain.

8. Consider two of the income security programs in the United States: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).

a. When a woman with children and very low income earns an extra dollar, she receives less in TANF benefits. What do you think is the effect of this feature of TANF on the labor supply of low-income women? Explain.

b. The EITC provides greater benefits as lowincome workers earn more income (up to a point). What do you think is the effect of this program on the labor supply of low-income individuals? Explain.

c. What are the disadvantages of eliminating TANF and allocating the savings to the EITC?
