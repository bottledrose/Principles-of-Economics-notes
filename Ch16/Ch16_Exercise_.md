## SUMMARY
- The economy's income is distributed in the markets for the factors of production. The three most important factors of production are labor, land, and capital.
- The demand for factors, such as labor, is a derived demand that comes from firms that use the factors to produce goods and services. Competitive, profitmaximizing firms hire each factor up to the point at which the value of the factor's marginal product equals its price.
- The supply of labor arises from individuals' tradeoff between work and leisure. An upward-sloping labor-supply curve means that people respond to an increase in the wage by working more hours and enjoying less leisure.
- The price paid to each factor adjusts to balance the supply and demand for that factor. Because factor demand reflects the value of the marginal product of that factor, in equilibrium each factor is compensated according to its marginal contribution to the production of goods and services.
- Because factors of production are used together, the marginal product of any one factor depends on the quantities of all factors that are available. As a result, a change in the supply of one factor alters the equilibrium earnings of all the factors.

8. Two athletes of equal ability are competing for a prize of $\$ 10,000$. Each is deciding whether to take a dangerous performance-enhancing drug. If one athlete takes the drug and the other does not, the one who takes the drug wins the prize. If both or neither take the drug, they tie and split the prize. Taking the drug imposes health risks that are equivalent to a loss of $X$ dollars.

a. Draw a $2 \times 2$ payoff matrix describing the decisions the athletes face.

b. For what $X$ is taking the drug the Nash equilibrium?

c. Does making the drug safer (that is, lowering $X$ ) make the athletes better or worse off? Explain.

9. Little Kona is a small coffee company that is considering entering a market dominated by Big Brew. Each company's profit depends on whether Little Kona enters and whether Big Brew sets a high price or a low price: a. Does either player in this game have a dominant strategy?

b. Does your answer to part (a) help you figure out what the other player should do?

c. What is the Nash equilibrium? Is there only one?

d. Big Brew threatens Little Kona by saying, "If you enter, we're going to set a low price, so you had better stay out." Do you think Little Kona should believe the threat? Why or why not?

e. If the two firms could collude and agree on how to split the total profits, what outcome would they pick?
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

1. Describe the three attributes of monopolistic competition. How is monopolistic competition like monopoly? How is it like perfect competition?

2. Draw a diagram depicting a firm that is making a profit in a monopolistically competitive market. Now show what happens to this firm as new firms enter the industry.

3. Draw a diagram of the long-run equilibrium in a monopolistically competitive market. How is price related to average total cost? How is price related to marginal cost?

7. Consider a monopolistically competitive market with $N$ firms. Each firm's business opportunities are described by the following equations:

\text { Total Cost: } T C & =50+Q^2 \\
\text { Marginal cost: } M C & =2 Q
\end{aligned}
