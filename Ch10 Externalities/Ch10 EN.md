# Ch10 Externalities
**externality**: the uncompensated impact of one personâ€™s actions on the well-being of a bystander

>without bearing the corresponding costs or receiving the corresponding benefits.

$~$

## 10.1 Externalities and Market Inefficiency

> In this section, we use the tools of welfare economics developed in Chapter 7 to examine how externalities affect economic well-being.

$~$

Externalities are divided into positive externalities and negative externalities:

+ Positive externalities: an economic entity's actions have a beneficial impact on others without receiving corresponding benefits
+ Negative externalities occur when an economic entity's actions have a detrimental impact on others without bearing the corresponding costs.

$~$

**Negative Externalities:**

Figure 10.2 Pollution Externality and the Social Optimum

![image-20240923142131083](./images/image-20240923142131083.png)

+ In the presence of a negative externality, such as pollution, the social cost of the good exceeds the **private cost**.
+ The **optimal quantity**, $Q_{OPTIMUM}$ , is therefore smaller than the equilibrium quantity, $Q_{MARKET}$

$~$

**Positive externalities:**

![image-20240923142500406](./images/image-20240923142500406.png)

+ In the presence of a positive externality, the social value of the good exceeds the private value.
+ The optimal quantity, $Q_{OPTIMUM}$ , is therefore larger than the equilibrium quantity, $Q_{MARKET}$

$~$

**Induction(Externalities and Economic Efficiency):**

The impact of externalities creates inconsistencies between private costs and social costs, or between private benefits and social benefits, which can easily lead to market failure and inefficiency.

Negative externalities

+ the social cost of production is greater than the private cost
+ the social supply curve is above the market supply curve
+ market production quantity exceeds the socially desirable quantity
+ overproduction of the product.

Positive externalities 

+ the social benefit of production is greater than the private benefit
+ the social value curve is above the market demand curve
+ market production quantity is less than the socially desirable quantity
+ underproduction of the product.

## 10.2 Methods to Solve Externalities

+ Public (Government) methods to solve externalities

  + Command-and-control policies: Regulation

  + Market-based policies:
    + Corrective Taxes and Subsidies

    + Tradable Pollution Permits

> Regulation regulate behavior directly.
>
> Market-based policies provide incentives so that private decision makers will choose to solve the problem on their own.

+ Private methods to solve externalities

  + Using moral norms and social constraints

  + Charitable behavior

  + Relying on the self-interest of relevant parties to solve externality problems

  + Signing contracts between interested parties.

$~$

### 10.2.1 Public methods to solve externalities

**Internalizing the externality:** altering incentives so that people take into account the external effects of their actions

>When the private marginal benefit or cost of a good or service is adjusted sufficiently to make individuals or firms consider the external effects they generate in their decision-making, the internalization of external effects is achieved.
>
>To this end, the government usually adopts two types of measures: corrective taxation and corrective fiscal subsidies.
>
>The former aims to adjust private marginal costs by imposing taxes equal to the size of the external marginal costs on goods or services with negative external effects, raising their private marginal costs to a level consistent with social marginal costs, thereby internalizing negative external effects.
>
>The latter aims to adjust private marginal benefits by providing fiscal subsidies equal to the size of the external marginal benefits to consumers of goods or services with positive external effects, raising their private marginal benefits to a level consistent with social marginal benefits, thereby internalizing positive external effects.

$~$

**Corrective tax (Pigouvian taxes):** a tax designed to induce private decision makers to take into account the social costs that arise from a negative externality.

$~$

An ideal corrective tax would equal the external cost from an activity with negative externalities, and an ideal corrective subsidy would equal the external benefit from an activity with positive externalities.

$~$

As long as the tax rate remains unchanged, the price of pollution remains constant, while the movement of the demand curve changes the amount of pollution, causing the pollution quantity to vary. (As shown in Figure 10.a)

$~$

Most taxes distort incentives and move the allocation of resources away from the social optimum. (As discussed in Chapter 8)

In contrast, corrective taxes alter incentives that market participants face to account for the presence of externalities and thereby move the allocation of resources closer to the social optimum. Thus, while corrective taxes raise revenue for the government, they also enhance economic efficiency.

$~$

> Example: *WHY IS GASOLINE TAXED SO HEAVILY?
>
> The gas tax can be viewed as a corrective tax aimed at addressing three negative externalities associated with driving: Congestion, Accidents, Pollution

$~$

**Tradable Pollution Permits:**

The pollution permit system: the government setting a total pollution quantity, issuing a certain amount of pollution permits to each enterprise, and allowing enterprises to trade these permits.

+ the issuance of pollution permits determines the amount of pollution.
+ As long as the number of permits remains unchanged, the pollution amount generally does not change
+ the movement of the demand curve changes the pollution price, causing the pollution price to decrease.(As shown in Figure 10.b)

$~$

+ In panel (a), the EPA sets a price on pollution by levying a corrective tax, and the demand curve determines the quantity of pollution.
+ In panel (b), the EPA limits the quantity of pollution by limiting the number of pollution permits, and the demand curve determines the price of pollution.
+ The **price** and **quantity of pollution** are the same in the two cases.

$~$

### 10.2.2 Private methods to solve externalities

+ Using moral norms and social constraints

+ Charitable behavior

+ Relying on the self-interest of relevant parties to solve externality problems

+ Signing contracts between interested parties.

$~$

**Coase theorem:** the proposition that if private parties can bargain without cost over the allocation of resources, they can solve the problem of externalities on their own.

+ Its content is: When **transaction costs** are zero, as long as property rights are clearly defined initially and economic parties are allowed to negotiate and trade, it will lead to efficient resource allocation.
+ The Coase theorem demonstrates that, if the assumptions hold, market forces are strong enough to solve externality problems through the market itself, without the need for government intervention.

**transaction costs:** the costs that parties incur during the process of agreeing to and following through on a bargain

>Transaction costs include: 
>
>1. costs of obtaining quality information about a product, such as product price, usability, and durability; 
>2. costs of negotiation between the parties to the transaction; 
>3. costs of contract performance by both parties to the transaction.
>
>The size of transaction costs depends on the following points:
>
>1. the number of transactions at a certain point in time over a period
>2. the quantity of goods traded at a certain point in time over a period
>3. the number of participants in each transaction
>4. the quantity of goods in each transaction.

$~$

Private economic entities may solve externality problems through the above methods, but in reality, due to some limiting factors, private entities cannot adequately address the problems caused by externalities. For example, transaction costs may be very expensive; all parties may strive to maximize their own interests, causing negotiations to break down; or because there are too many stakeholders involved, it may be impossible to coordinate all interests. Therefore, government intervention is needed to solve externality problems, internalize externalities, and achieve Pareto optimality.

$~$

## Conclusion

The market can maximize the total surplus of sellers and buyers in the market, and this is usually efficient.

However, if externalities appear in the market, market equilibrium cannot maximize the total benefits for the entire society, making the market inefficient.

The Coase theorem believes that they can negotiate themselves and reach an effective solution.

However, if **transaction costs** are high, government policies are needed to improve efficiency.

Pigouvian taxes and pollution permit systems are superior to command-and-control policies because they reduce pollution at lower costs, thereby increasing the demand for a clean environment.

SUMMARY

- When a transaction between a buyer and seller directly affects a third party, the effect is called an externality. If an activity yields negative externalities, such as pollution, the socially optimal quantity in a market is less than the equilibrium quantity. If an activity yields positive externalities, such as technology spillovers, the socially optimal quantity is greater than the equilibrium quantity.
- Governments pursue various policies to remedy the inefficiencies caused by externalities. Sometimes the government prevents socially inefficient activity by regulating behavior. Other times it internalizes an externality using corrective taxes. Another public policy is to issue permits. For example, the government could protect the environment by issuing a limited number of pollution permits. The result of this policy is similar to imposing corrective taxes on polluters.
- Those affected by externalities can sometimes solve the problem privately. For instance, when one business imposes an externality on another business, the two businesses can internalize the externality by merging. Alternatively, the interested parties can solve the problem by negotiating a contract. According to the Coase theorem, if people can bargain without cost, then they can always reach an agreement in which resources are allocated efficiently. In many cases, however, reaching a bargain among the many interested parties is difficult, so the Coase theorem does not apply.
