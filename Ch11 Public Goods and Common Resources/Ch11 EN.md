## 11.1 The Different Kinds of Goods

**excludability:** the property of a good whereby a person can be prevented from using it.

**rivalry in consumption:** the property of a good whereby one person’s use diminishes other people’s use.

$~$

When thinking about the various goods in the economy, it is useful to group them according to two characteristics:

+ Is the good excludable? That is, can people be prevented from using the good?
+ Is the good rival in consumption? That is, does one person’s use of the good reduce another person’s ability to use it?

|                  | Excludable | Rival in Consumption |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| private goods    | ✓          | ✓                    |
| public goods     | ×          | ×                    |
| common resources | ×          | ✓                    |
| club goods       | ✓          | ×                    |

$~$

**Private Goods:**

e.g. Ice-cream cones, Clothing, Congested toll roads

+ Private Goods is excludable because it is possible to prevent someone from eating an ice-cream cone—you just don’t give it to her.
+ Private Goods is rival in consumption because if one person eats an ice-cream cone, another person cannot eat the same cone.
+ Most goods in the economy are private goods.
+ When we analyzed supply and demand, and the efficiency of markets, we implicitly assumed that goods were both excludable and rival in consumption.

$~$

**Public Goods:**

e.g. Tornado siren, National defense, Uncongested nontoll roads, general knowledge, fighting poverty

+ public good is not excludable because it is impossible to prevent any single person from hearing the tornado siren when it sounds.
+ public good is not Rival in Consumption because when one person gets the benefit of the tornado warning, she does not reduce the benefit to anyone else (so it is not rival in consumption).

> General knowledge is a public good. For example, a mathematician cannot patent a theorem.
>
> However, specific technological knowledge, such as the invention of a smaller microchip, can be patented. The patent gives the inventor the exclusive right to the knowledge. In other words, the patent makes the knowledge excludable.

$~$

**Common Resources:**

e.g. Fish in the ocean, The environment, Congested nontoll roads

+ Common Resources not excludable because it is difficult to stop fishermen from taking fish out of a vast ocean.
+ Common Resources are rival in consumption because when one person catches fish, there are fewer fish for the next person to catch.

$~$

**Club Goods:**

e.g. Fire protection, Cable TV, Uncongested toll roads

+ Club Goods are excludable because, take fire protection in a small town as example, It is easy to exclude someone from using this good: The fire department can just let her house burn down.
+ Club Goods is not rival in consumption, because once a town has paid for the fire department, the additional cost of protecting one more house is small.

## 11.2 Public Goods

$~$

### 11.2.1 The Free-Rider Problem

**free rider:** a person who receives the benefit of a good but avoids paying for it

$~$

Since public goods are non-excludable, the free rider problem arises, meaning people can benefit from a good without paying for it. The free rider problem eliminates the possibility of public goods being provided by private markets, as only the government can cover the costs of public goods through taxation, ensuring that everyone can enjoy the benefits of these goods.

$~$

### 11.2.2 The Difficult Job of Cost–Benefit Analysis

**cost–benefit analysis:** a study that compares the costs and benefits to society of providing a public good

$~$

Intrinsically, the efficient provision of public goods is  more difficult than the efficient provision of private goods.

+ The government must determine what kinds of public goods to provide and in what quantities.
+ There is no price with which to judge the value of the public goods, so cost–benefit analysts do not have any price signals to observe when evaluating whether the government should provide a public good and how much to provide.

$~$

## 11.3 Common Resources

$~$

Common resources are not excludable but rival in consumption. Thus once common resources are provided, policymakers need to be concerned about how much they are used. Take the classic parable the Tragedy of the Commons as an example.

$~$

### 11.3.1 The Tragedy of the Commons

Content:

On public grasslands, shepherds who increase their flock sizes without regard for the land's carrying capacity see their profits rise as the number of sheep increases. Observing this profitability, many other shepherds join in this practice. As there are no restrictions on the entry of sheep, the pasture becomes overused, and the condition of the grassland rapidly deteriorates.

The commons, as a resource or property, has multiple owners, each of whom has the right to use it but no right to exclude others from using it, resulting in overexploitation and depletion of the resource.

The property rights of common resources are difficult to define (or the costs of defining property rights are too high), leading to competitive overuse or encroachment.

$~$

## Conclusion: The Importance of Property Rights

In this and the previous chapter, we have seen there are some “goods” that the market does not provide adequately:

+ Markets do not ensure that the air we breathe is clean 
+ Markets do not ensure that our country is defended from foreign aggressors.

Instead, societies rely on the government to protect the environment and to provide for the national defense.

In these cases, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently because property rights are not well established. That is, some item of value does not have an owner with the legal authority to control it.

For example, although the environment and national defense is valuable, no one has the right to attach a price to it and profit from its use.

+ A factory pollutes too much because no one charges the factory for the pollution it emits.
+ The market does not provide for national defense because no one can charge those who are defended for the benefit they receive.

$~$

When the absence of property rights causes a market failure, the government can potentially solve the problem:

+ help define property rights and thereby unleash market forces: the sale of pollution permits
+ regulate private behavior: restricted hunting seasons
+ use tax revenue to supply a good that the market fails to supply: the provision of national defense

$~$

In each of these cases, if the policy is well planned and well run, it can make the allocation of resources more efficient and thus raise economic well-being.
