## 11.1 The Different Kinds of Goods

**excludability:** the property of a good whereby a person can be prevented from using it.

**rivalry in consumption:** the property of a good whereby one person’s use diminishes other people’s use.

$~$

When thinking about the various goods in the economy, it is useful to group them according to two characteristics:

+ Is the good excludable? That is, can people be prevented from using the good?
+ Is the good rival in consumption? That is, does one person’s use of the good reduce another person’s ability to use it?

|                  | Excludable | Rival in Consumption |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| private goods    | ✓          | ✓                    |
| public goods     | ×          | ×                    |
| common resources | ×          | ✓                    |
| club goods       | ✓          | ×                    |

$~$

**Private Goods:**

e.g. Ice-cream cones, Clothing, Congested toll roads

+ Private Goods is excludable because it is possible to prevent someone from eating an ice-cream cone—you just don’t give it to her.
+ Private Goods is rival in consumption because if one person eats an ice-cream cone, another person cannot eat the same cone.
+ Most goods in the economy are private goods.
+ When we analyzed supply and demand, and the efficiency of markets, we implicitly assumed that goods were both excludable and rival in consumption.

$~$

**Public Goods:**

e.g. Tornado siren, National defense, Uncongested nontoll roads, general knowledge, fighting poverty

+ public good is not excludable because it is impossible to prevent any single person from hearing the tornado siren when it sounds.
+ public good is not Rival in Consumption because when one person gets the benefit of the tornado warning, she does not reduce the benefit to anyone else (so it is not rival in consumption).

> General knowledge is a public good. For example, a mathematician cannot patent a theorem.
>
> However, specific technological knowledge, such as the invention of a smaller microchip, can be patented. The patent gives the inventor the exclusive right to the knowledge. In other words, the patent makes the knowledge excludable.

$~$

**Common Resources:**

e.g. Fish in the ocean, The environment, Congested nontoll roads

+ Common Resources not excludable because it is difficult to stop fishermen from taking fish out of a vast ocean.
+ Common Resources are rival in consumption because when one person catches fish, there are fewer fish for the next person to catch.

$~$

**Club Goods:**

e.g. Fire protection, Cable TV, Uncongested toll roads

+ Club Goods are excludable because, take fire protection in a small town as example, It is easy to exclude someone from using this good: The fire department can just let her house burn down.
+ Club Goods is not rival in consumption, because once a town has paid for the fire department, the additional cost of protecting one more house is small. 

$~$

## 11.2 Public Goods

$~$

### 11.2.1 The Free-Rider Problem

**free rider:** a person who receives the benefit of a good but avoids paying for it

$~$

Since public goods are non-excludable, the free rider problem arises, meaning people can benefit from a good without paying for it. The free rider problem eliminates the possibility of public goods being provided by private markets, as only the government can cover the costs of public goods through taxation, ensuring that everyone can enjoy the benefits of these goods.

$~$

### 11.2.2 The Difficult Job of Cost–Benefit Analysis

**cost–benefit analysis:** a study that compares the costs and benefits to society of providing a public good

$~$

Intrinsically, the efficient provision of public goods is  more difficult than the efficient provision of private goods.

+ The government must determine what kinds of public goods to provide and in what quantities.
+ There is no price with which to judge the value of the public goods, so cost–benefit analysts do not have any price signals to observe when evaluating whether the government should provide a public good and how much to provide.

$~$

## 11.3 Common Resources

$~$

Common resources are not excludable but rival in consumption. Thus once common resources are provided, policymakers need to be concerned about how much they are used. Take the classic parable the Tragedy of the Commons as an example.

$~$

### 11.3.1 The Tragedy of the Commons

Content:

On public grasslands, shepherds who increase their flock sizes without regard for the land's carrying capacity see their profits rise as the number of sheep increases. Observing this profitability, many other shepherds join in this practice. As there are no restrictions on the entry of sheep, the pasture becomes overused, and the condition of the grassland rapidly deteriorates.

The commons, as a resource or property, has multiple owners, each of whom has the right to use it but no right to exclude others from using it, resulting in overexploitation and depletion of the resource.

The property rights of common resources are difficult to define (or the costs of defining property rights are too high), leading to competitive overuse or encroachment.

$~$

## Conclusion: The Importance of Property Rights

In this and the previous chapter, we have seen there are some “goods” that the market does not provide adequately:

+ Markets do not ensure that the air we breathe is clean 
+ Markets do not ensure that our country is defended from foreign aggressors.

Instead, societies rely on the government to protect the environment and to provide for the national defense.

In these cases, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently because property rights are not well established. That is, some item of value does not have an owner with the legal authority to control it.

For example, although the environment and national defense is valuable, no one has the right to attach a price to it and profit from its use.

+ A factory pollutes too much because no one charges the factory for the pollution it emits.
+ The market does not provide for national defense because no one can charge those who are defended for the benefit they receive.

$~$

When the absence of property rights causes a market failure, the government can potentially solve the problem:

+ help define property rights and thereby unleash market forces: the sale of pollution permits
+ regulate private behavior: restricted hunting seasons
+ use tax revenue to supply a good that the market fails to supply: the provision of national defense

$~$

In each of these cases, if the policy is well planned and well run, it can make the allocation of resources more efficient and thus raise economic well-being.

SUMMARY

- Goods differ in whether they are excludable and whether they are rival in consumption. A good is excludable if it is possible to prevent someone from using it. A good is rival in consumption if one person's use of the good reduces others' ability to use the same unit of the good. Markets work best for private goods, which are both excludable and rival in consumption. Markets do not work as well for other types of goods.

- Public goods are neither rival in consumption nor excludable. Examples of public goods include fireworks displays, national defense, and the discovery of fundamental knowledge. Because people are not charged for their use of the public good, they have an incentive to free ride, making private provision of the good untenable. Therefore, governments provide public goods, basing their decision about the quantity of each good on cost-benefit analysis.

- Common resources are rival in consumption but not excludable. Examples include common grazing land, clean air, and congested roads. Because people are not charged for their use of common resources, they tend to use them excessively. Therefore, governments use various methods, such as regulations and corrective taxes, to limit the use of common resources.

a. What name do economists have for people like Fredo?

b. How can the government solve the problem caused by people like Fredo?

c. Can you think of ways the private market can solve this problem? How does the existence of cable TV alter the situation?

4. Wireless, high-speed Internet is provided for free in the airport of the city of Communityville.

a. At first, only a few people use the service. What type of a good is this and why?

b. Eventually, as more people find out about the service and start using it, the speed of the connection begins to fall. Now what type of a good is the wireless Internet service?

c. What problem might result and why? What is one possible way to correct this problem?

5. Four roommates are planning to spend the weekend in their dorm room watching old movies, and they are debating how many to watch. Here is their willingness to pay for each film:
6. 
|                   | Steven | Peter  | James  | Christopher |
|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| First film        | \$ 7 | \$ 5 | \$ 3 | \$ 2      |
| Second film       | 6      | 4      | 2      | 1           |
| Third film        | 5      | 3      | 1      | 0           |
| Fourth film       | 4      | 2      | 0      | 0           |
| Fifth film        | 3      | 1      | 0      | 0           |


a. Within the dorm room, is the showing of a movie a public good? Why or why not?

b. If it costs $\$ 8$ to rent a movie, how many movies should the roommates rent to maximize total surplus?

c. If they choose the optimal number from part (b) and then split the cost of renting the movies equally, how much surplus does each person obtain from watching the movies?

d. Is there any way to split the cost to ensure that everyone benefits? What practical problems does this solution raise?

e. Suppose they agree in advance to choose the efficient number and to split the cost of the movies equally. When Steven is asked his willingness to pay, will he have an incentive to tell the truth? If so, why? If not, what will he be tempted to say?

f. What does this example teach you about the optimal provision of public goods?

6. Some economists argue that private firms will not undertake the efficient amount of basic scientific research.

a. Explain why this might be so. In your answer, classify basic research in one of the categories shown in Figure 1.

b. What sort of policy has the United States adopted in response to this problem?

c. It is often argued that this policy increases the technological capability of American producers relative to that of foreign firms. Is this argument consistent with your classification of basic research in part (a)? (Hint: Can excludability apply to some potential beneficiaries of a public good and not others?)

7. Two towns, each with three members, are deciding whether to put on a fireworks display to celebrate the New Year. Fireworks cost \$360. In each town, some people enjoy fireworks more than others.

a. In the town of Bayport, each of the residents values the public good as follows:

| Frank  | \$ 50  |
|--------|--------|
| Joe    | \$ 100 |
| Callie | \$ 300 |


Would fireworks pass a cost-benefit analysis? Explain.

b. The mayor of Bayport proposes to decide by majority rule and, if the fireworks referendum passes, to split the cost equally among all residents. Who would vote in favor, and who would vote against? Would the vote yield the same answer as the cost-benefit analysis?

c. In the town of River Heights, each of the residents values the public good as follows:

Nancy \$ 20 Bess \$ 140 Ned \$ 160

Would fireworks pass a cost-benefit analysis? Explain.

d. The mayor of River Heights also proposes to decide by majority rule and, if the fireworks referendum passes, to split the cost equally among all residents. Who would vote in favor, and who would vote against? Would the vote yield the same answer as the cost-benefit analysis?

e. What do you think these examples say about the optimal provision of public goods?

8. There is often litter along highways but rarely in people's yards. Provide an economic 
explanation for this fact.

9. Many transportation systems, such as the Washington, D.C., Metro (subway), charge higher fares during rush hours than during the rest of the day. Why might they do this?

10. High-income people are willing to pay more than lower-income people to avoid the risk of death. For example, they are more likely to pay for safety features on cars. Do you think cost-benefit analysts should take this fact into account when evaluating public projects? Consider, for instance, a rich town and a poor town, both of which are considering the installation of a traffic light. Should the rich town use a higher dollar value for a human life in making this decision? Why or why not?
