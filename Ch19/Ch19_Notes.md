# Ch19 Earnings and Discrimination



## 19-1 Some Determinants of Equilibrium Wages


1. **compensating differential**: a difference in wages that arises to offset the nonmonetary characteristics of different jobs

>+ Coal miners are paid more than other workers with similar levels of education. Their higher wage compensates them for the dirty and dangerous nature of coal mining, as well as the long-term health problems that coal miners experience.
>+ Workers who work the night shift at factories are paid more than similar workers who work the day shift. The higher wage compensates them for having to work at night and sleep during the day, a lifestyle that most people find undesirable.
>+ Professors are paid less than lawyers and doctors, who have similar amounts of education. The higher wages of lawyers and doctors compensate them for missing out on the great intellectual and personal satisfaction that professors’ jobs offer. (Indeed, teaching economics is so much fun that it is surprising economics professors are paid anything at all!)

2. **human capital**: the accumulation of investments in people, such as education and on-the-job training.

>The most important type of human capital is education. Workers with more human capital earn more on average than those with less human capitl.

3.  Natural Ability, Effort, and Chance 天生的能力、努力和机遇

4.  An Alternative View of Education: Signaling

According to this alternative view, when people earn a college degree,  they do not become more productive, but they do signal their high ability to prospective employers.

Thus, we now have two views of education: 

+ Human-capital view: Education makes workers more productive. Increasing educational levels for all workers would raise all workers’ productivity and thereby their wages.
+ Signaling view, education is correlated with natural ability.  Education does not enhance productivity, so raising all workers’ educational levels would not affect wages.


5. The Superstar Phenomenon

>Superstars arise in markets that have two characteristics:
>+ Every customer in the market wants to enjoy the good supplied by the best producer.
>+ The good is produced with a technology that makes it possible for the best producer to supply every customer at low cost.

6. Above-Equilibrium Wages: Minimum-Wage Laws, Unions, and Efficiency Wages

+ **union**: a worker association that bargains with employers over wages and working conditions
+ **strike**: the organized withdrawal of labor from a firm by a union
+ **efficiency wages**: above-equilibrium wages paid by firms to increase worker productivity

## 19-2 The Economics of Discrimination

Another source of differences in wages is discrimination.

**Discrimination**: the offering of different opportunities to similar individuals who differ only by race, ethnic group, sex, age, or other personal characteristics.

**Measuring Labor-Market Discrimination:**

This question is important, but answering it is not easy, because of differences in human capital and job characteristics.

**Discrimination by Employers:**

Competitive markets tend to limit the effect of discrimination on wages. If the wages of one group of workers are lower than those of another group of workers for reasons unrelated to marginal productivity, then non-discriminating firms will be more profitable. Thus, profit-maximizing behavior reduces discriminatory wage differentials.

**Discrimination by Customers and Governments:**

While the profit motive is a powerful force in eliminating discriminatory wage differentials, customer preferences and government policies can limit the ability to correct for this force.

Discrimination in competitive markets continues when customers are willing to pay to maintain discriminatory practices, or when the government mandates discrimination.
